This character is currently referred to as BOR (Battery-Operated Robot) 
because I don't know what his true function is.
To import BOR.fbx:
-click Import
-make sure checkboxes for "Skeletal Mesh" and "Import Mesh" are checked
-check the box "Use TOAs Ref Pose"
-make sure the box "Preserve Smoothing Group" is checked
-make sure the box "Meshes in Bone" is checked
-everything else I believe is supposed to be the same
-click Import All

To import BOR_anim_.fbx:
-click Import
-In the Mesh section, under skeleton, click the scroll bar and select BOR_Skeleton
-Make sure Animation Length is "Exported Time"
-Leave everything else the same
-click Import All

*His run animation has a bit of a jitter every second step. I'll continue working 
on it to see if I can improve it, but I figure something is better than nothing 
right now. I'm also going to make a BOR_anim_runjump.fbx and a BOR_anim_walk.fbx.
